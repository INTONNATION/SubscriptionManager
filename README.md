## Recurring Payments ('Subscriptions') smart-contract system

Monthly subscriptions are a key monetization channel for legacy web, and arguably they are the most healthy monetization channel for businesses (especially when compared to ad/surveillance) based models. But in the blockchain world there haven’t been any successful full-featured crypto subscription payment systems yet. We aim to change this. In our project called “Subscription Manager” we focused on user experience and user interface(DeBot) to access this system. We believe it’s a key to mass adoption. Goal of our subscription system is to move users and existing subscription services on Free TON with the closest to legacy web experience but with a higher level of security and guarantee. Currently we focused on subscription by TON Crystal to simplify user access to this system (in case of TIP3 users will need to have TON Crystal for gas payment and TIP3 token to subscribe), but proposed architecture can be extended in future to support TIP3 wallets as well.
